.TH ldns-verifyzone 1 "27 May 2008"
.SH NAME
ldns-verify-zone \- read a DNSSEC signed zone and verify it.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ldns-verify-zone 
.IR ZONEFILE 

.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBldns-verify-zone\fR reads a DNS zone file and verifies it. 

RRSIG resource records are checked against the DNSKEY set at the zone apex.

Each name is checked for an NSEC(3), if appropriate.

If ZONEMD resource records are present, one of them needs to match the zone content.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-h\fR
Show usage and exit

.TP
\fB-a\fR
Apex only, check only the zone apex

.TP
\fB-e\fR \fIperiod\fR
Signatures may not expire within this period.
Default no period is used.

.TP
\fB-i\fR \fIperiod\fR
Signatures must have been valid at least this long.
Default signatures should just be valid now.

.TP
\fB-k\fR \fIfile\fR
A file that contains a trusted DNSKEY or DS rr.
This option may be given more than once.

Alternatively, if \fB-k\fR is not specified, and a default trust anchor
(@LDNS_TRUST_ANCHOR_FILE@) exists and contains a valid DNSKEY or DS record,
it will be used as the trust anchor.
.TP
\fB-p\fR \fI[0-100]\fR
Only check this percentage of the zone.
Which names to check is determined randomly.
Defaults to 100.

.TP
\fB-S\fR
Chase signature(s) to a known key.
The network may be accessed to validate the zone's DNSKEYs. (implies \-k)

.TP
\fB-t\fR \fIYYYYMMDDhhmmss | [+|-]offset\fR
Set the validation time either by an absolute time value or as an offset in seconds from the current time.

.TP
\fB-v\fR
Show the version and exit

.TP
\fB-V\fR \fInumber\fR
Set the verbosity level (default 3):

 0: Be silent
 1: Print result, and any errors
 2: Same as 1 for now
 3: Print result, any errors, and the names that are
    being checked
 4: Same as 3 for now
 5: Print the zone after it has been read, the result, 
    any errors, and the names that are being checked

.TP
\fB-Z\fR
Requires a valid ZONEMD RR to be present. When given once, this option will
permit verifying only the ZONEMD RR of an unsigned zone. When given more than
once, the zone needs to be validly DNSSEC signed as well.

.TP
\fB-ZZZ\fR
When three times a \fB-Z\fR option is given, the ZONEMD RR to be verified is
considered "detached" and does not need to have valid signatures.

.LP
\fIperiod\fRs are given in ISO 8601 duration format:
.RS
P[n]Y[n]M[n]DT[n]H[n]M[n]S
.RE
.LP
If no file is given standard input is read.

.SH "FILES"
.TP
@LDNS_TRUST_ANCHOR_FILE@
The file from which trusted keys are loaded for signature chasing,
when no \fB-k\fR option is given.

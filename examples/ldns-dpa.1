.SH NAME
dpa \- DNS Packet Analyzer. Analyze DNS packets in ip trace files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dpa
[
.IR OPTION
]
.IR TRACEFILE 

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdpa\fR is used to analyze dns packets in trace files. It has 3 main options: count, filter, and count uniques (i.e. count all different occurrences).

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-c\fR \fIexpressionlist\fR
Count occurrences of matching expressions

.TP
\fB-f\fR \fIexpression\fR
Filter: only process packets that match the expression

.TP
\fB-h\fR 
Show usage

.TP
\fB-p\fR
Show the total number of correct DNS packets, and percentage of \-u and
\-c values  (of the total of matching on the \-f filter. if no filter is
given, percentages are on all correct dns packets)

.TP
\fB-of\fR \fIfile\fR
Write all packets that match the \-f flag to file, as pcap data.

.TP
\fB-ofh\fR \fIfile\fR
Write all packets that match the \-f flag to file, in hexadecimal format,
readable by drill.

.TP
\fB-s\fR
Show possible match names

.TP
\fB-s\fR \fImatchname\fR
show possible match operators and values for name

.TP
\fB-sf\fR
Only evaluate packets (in representation format) that match the \-f filter.
If no \-f was given, evaluate all correct dns packets.

.TP
\fB-u\fR \fImatchnamelist\fR
Count every occurrence of every value of the matchname (for instance, count all packetsizes, see EXAMPLES in ldns-dpa(1) ).

.TP
\fB-ua\fR
For every matchname in \-u, show the average value of all matches. Behaviour for match types that do not have an integer value is undefined.

.TP
\fB-uac\fR
For every matchname in \-u, show the average number of times this value was encountered.

.TP
\fB-um\fR \fInumber\fR
Only show the results from \-u for values that occurred more than <number> times.

.TP
\fB-v\fR \fIlevel\fR
Set verbosity to level (1-5, 5 being the highest). Mostly used for debugging.

.TP
\fB-notip\fR \fIfile\fR
Write packets that were not recognized as IP packets to file (as pcap data).

.TP
\fB-baddns\fR \fIfile\fR
Write dns packets that were too mangled to parse to file (as pcap data).

.TP
\fB-version\fR
Show version and exit

.SH LIST AND MATCHES

A <matchnamelist> is a comma separated list of match names (use \-s to see possible match names).
A <expressionlist> is a comma separated list of expressions.

An expression has the following form:
<expr>: (<expr>)
        <expr> | <expr>
        <expr> & <expr>
        <match>

<match>:        <matchname> <operator> <value>

<operator>:
	=	equal to <value>
	!=	not equal to <value>
	>	greater than <value>
	<	lesser than <value>
	>=	greater than or equal to <value>
	<=	lesser than or equal to <value>
	~=	contains <value>

See the \-s option for possible matchnames, operators and values.

.SH EXAMPLES

.TP
ldns-dpa \-u packetsize \-p test.tr
Count all different packetsizes in test.tr and show the percentages.

.TP
ldns-dpa \-f "edns=1&qr=0" \-of edns.tr test.tr
Filter out all edns enable queries in test.tr and put them in edns.tr

.TP
ldns-dpa \-f edns=1 \-c tc=1 \-u rcode test.tr
For all edns packets, count the number of truncated packets and all their rcodes in test.tr.

.TP
ldns-dpa \-c tc=1,qr=0,qr=1,opcode=QUERY test.tr
For all packets, count the number of truncated packets, the number of packets with qr=0, the number of packets with qr=1 and the number of queries in test.tr.

.TP
ldns-dpa \-u packetsize \-ua test.tr
Show all packet sizes and the average packet size per packet.

.TP
ldns-dpa \-u srcaddress \-uac test.tr
Show all packet source addresses and the average number of packets sent from this address.

.TP
sudo tcpdump \-i eth0 \-s 0 \-U \-w \- port 53 | ldns-dpa \-f qr=0 \-sf
Print all query packets seen on the specified interface.

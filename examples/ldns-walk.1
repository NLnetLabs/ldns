.SH NAME
ldns-walk \- Retrieve the contents of a DNSSEC signed zone
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ldns-walk
[
.IR OPTION
]
.IR ZONE 

.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBldns-walk\fR is used to retrieve the contents of a DNSSEC signed zone.
It does this through NSEC-walking (following the chain of NSEC records)
and 'guessing' the next non-existent owner name for each NSEC.

Note that it might get stuck on some wildcard records when used through a
caching forwarder. This problem can be circumvented by querying the
authoritative nameserver directly (with the @ argument).

Of course the nameserver that is used must be DNSSEC-aware.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-4\fR
Use only IPv4.

.TP
\fB-6\fR
Use only IPv6.

.TP
\fB-f\fR
Do a 'full' zone walk; by default, ldns-walk will only show the names, and types present at those names. If this option is given, all resource records will be printed.

.TP
\fB-s\fR \fIname\fR
Start the walk with this owner name. Useful when continuing the walk for a
large zone.

.TP
\fB-v\fR \fIverbosity\fR
Verbosity level [1-5].

.TP
\fB@\fR \fInameserver\fR
Send the queries to this nameserver.

.SH BUGS

LDNSX: Easy DNS (including DNSSEC) via ldns.

ldns is a great library. It is a powerful tool for
working with DNS. python-ldns it is a straight up clone of the C
interface, however that is not a very good interface for python. Its
documentation is incomplete and some functions don't work as
described. And some objects don't have a full python API.

ldnsx aims to fix this. It wraps around the ldns python bindings,
working around its limitations and providing a well-documented, more
pythonistic interface.

Examples
========

Query the default resolver for google.com's A records. Print the response
packet.

>>> import ldnsx
>>> resolver = ldnsx.resolver()
>>> print resolver.query("google.com","A")

Print the NS records for com. from f.root-servers.net if we get a
response, else an error message.

>>> import ldnsx
>>> pkt = ldnsx.resolver("f.root-servers.net").query("com.","NS")
>>> if pkt:
>>>    for rr in pkt.answer():
>>>       print rr
>>> else:
>>>    print "response not received"

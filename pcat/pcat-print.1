.SH NAME
pcat-print \- reformat hexadecimal packets back to dig-like syntax
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pcat-printp
[
.IR \-h
]
.IR PCAT_STREAM

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpcat-print\fR reads in a pcat file and reformats the hexadecimal
packets back into a dig-like syntax. If a packet cannot be transformed
back into a sane syntax an error is emitted.

This makes the manual inspection of the packets easier.

.PP
If no pcat file is given, standard input is read.

.SH OPTIONS
There are no options. Like \fBpcat-diff\fR this utility always does
what you want.

.SH OUTPUT FORMAT
\fBpcat-print\fR will output records. 
Each record consists of an index and then three packets.
Each packet is separated by a line of '='s. All in all the output looks
like:

        ==========================
        ==========================
        Index: xxx:yyy
        ==========================
        query packet
        ==========================
        first answer/query packet
        ==========================
        second answer/query packet
        ==========================
.PP
For the index: xxx:yyy. xxx is the query ID of the first answer/query and
yyy is the query ID of the second one. These two IDs should match. The query
ID of the query packet is also equal to xxx.

.SH ALSO SEE
Also see pcat(1) and pcat-diff(1).

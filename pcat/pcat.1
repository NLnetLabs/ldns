.SH NAME
pcat \- (re)-send a pcap trace to a nameserver
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pcat
[
.IR \-a
IP
]
[
.IR \-p
PORT
]
.IR PCAP_STRACE

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpcat\fR reads in a pcap trace file and re-sends the packet's payload 
to a nameserver. It prints each query and the reply to standard output
is a hexadecimal format.
.PP
If no pcap file is given, standard input is read.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-a IP
Use IP as address to send the queries to.
.TP
.B \-p PORT
Use PORT as port number.

.SH OUTPUT FORMAT
The output of \fBpcat\fR consists "records". Each record has four lines:
.PP
    1. xxx         - (decimal) sequence number
    2. hex dump    - query in hex, network order
    3. hex dump    - answer in hex, network order
    4. empty line  

The reason for the fourth line is that \fBpcat-print\fR can now parse
both \fBpcat\fRs and \fBpcat-diff\fRs output.
.PP
This format is dubbed: \fBpcat\fR.
